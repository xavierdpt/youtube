# [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/@Java.Brains)

## [Reactive Programming with Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTYPR2oH7kgElMYZhJd4vOGI)

## [01 Course Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EExlnnq5Grs)

- [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/)
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)

Blocking I/O vs. Non-blocking I/O \
Synchronous vs. asynchronous

Reactive streams\
Operators

Java 11 or Java 17

## [02 What is reactive programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHmM0EOmAS8)

Propagation of change

Reactive programming =/= asynchrounous

## [03 Why do reactive programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se3KMW_VdcU)

It's better to call multiple services in parallel when possible, and to combine the data as needed.

## [04 Async in server side apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccf7QlFwzcA)

- `CompletableFuture`
- `CompletionStage`

- `supplyAsync()` to call asynchronous operations
- `allOf()` to encapsulate them in a single `CompletableFuture`
- `join()` to wait for them all
- then `join()` again to collect the individual results of each request

Last `join()` is still blocking the request thread.
